# 🚀 Enterprise Intelligence System - Deployment Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Both enterprise enhancements have been successfully implemented:

### 🧠 Enhancement #1: Insight Graph (Intelligence Layer)
- **File**: `claude_capture/integrations/knowledge_graph_engine.py`
- **Features**:
  - Neo4j graph database support with SQLite fallback
  - Node types: Insight, Decision, Action_Item, File, Session, Test, Agent
  - Relationship mappings: WAS_DISCUSSED_IN, WAS_INFORMED_BY, RESULTS_FROM, etc.
  - Pattern-based intelligence extraction
  - Decision traceability queries

### 👥 Enhancement #2: Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework  
- **File**: `claude_capture/integrations/multi_agent_collaboration.py`
- **Features**:
  - User authentication with roles (Admin, Senior PM, Developer, etc.)
  - Channel-based intelligence streams (#project-, #research-, #infrastructure-)
  - Team-wide search and analytics
  - Intelligence entry tracking with importance scoring

### 🎯 Integration Layer
- **File**: `claude_capture/integrations/enterprise_intelligence_system.py`
- **Features**:
  - Combines knowledge graph + collaboration framework
  - Unified search across both systems
  - Real-time dashboard data generation
  - Cross-system relationship mapping

## 🛠️ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install sqlite3 neo4j watchdog
```

### 2. Test the System
```bash
# From project root
python claude_capture/integrations/enterprise_intelligence_system.py
```

### 3. Optional: Neo4j Setup
```bash
# Download Neo4j Desktop or Community Edition
# Create database with credentials
# Update neo4j_config in initialization
```

## 🎉 System Capabilities

### Knowledge Graph Features:
- **Decision Traceability**: "Show me all insights that led to using 60-day lookback"
- **Session Analytics**: Track all insights/decisions from specific sessions
- **File Modification History**: See what decisions affected which files
- **Insight Networks**: Explore relationships between insights

### Collaboration Features:
- **Multi-User Support**: Team members with different roles and permissions
- **Channel-Based Intelligence**: Organized by project, research, infrastructure
- **Team Analytics**: Activity metrics, decision velocity, insight generation
- **Search & Discovery**: Full-text search across all team intelligence

### Enterprise Integration:
- **Unified Search**: Search both knowledge graph and collaboration data
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Live metrics and activity feeds
- **Cross-System Relationships**: Link collaboration entries to graph nodes
- **Decision Trace Queries**: Follow the complete path of any decision

## 📊 Example Usage

```python
# Initialize system
eis = EnterpriseIntelligenceSystem()

# Authenticate user
eis.authenticate_and_set_context("alice_dev", "auth_token")
eis.set_channel_context("#project-aie-core")

# Capture conversation
result = eis.capture_and_process_conversation(
    "risk_calculator.py",
    "Discovered that 60-day lookback provides better signal. Decision: Implement across all strategies.",
    "conv_123"
)

# Execute decision trace
trace = eis.execute_decision_trace_query("60-day lookback")

# Generate team report
report = eis.generate_team_intelligence_report("Engineering", "week")

# Unified search
results = eis.search_across_systems("lookback period")
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Default Channels Created:
- `#project-aie-core` - Core development discussions
- `#research-new-signals` - Research on trading signals  
- `#infrastructure-devops` - Infrastructure discussions
- `#strategy-planning` - Strategic planning
- `#general` - General announcements

### User Roles:
- **ADMIN** - Full system access
- **SENIOR_PM** - Project management capabilities
- **RESEARCHER** - Research channel access
- **DEVELOPER** - Development channel access
- **ANALYST** - Analytics and reporting
- **VIEWER** - Read-only access

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the Implementation**: Run the main demo script
2. **Create Users**: Add team members with appropriate roles
3. **Set Up Channels**: Create project-specific channels
4. **Optional Neo4j**: Set up graph database for advanced queries
5. **Dashboard UI**: Create web interface for intelligence dashboard
